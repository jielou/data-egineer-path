# data structure

## 1. Linked List
each element in the linked list points to the next node.

advantages: save memory

disadvantages: look up time

### doubly linked list
each node has one more pointer pointing to the previous node

## 2. stack
first in last out

application: undo and two-stack algorithm (recursive elements/operations)

push: add element

pop: remove the recently added element

python implementation: deque library
## 3. queue

first in first out

enqueue: add element at the last

dequeue: remove element in the front

python implementation: deque library

application: load things
