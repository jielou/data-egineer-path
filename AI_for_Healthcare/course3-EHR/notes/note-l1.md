# Applying AI to EHR Data Introduction

## terminology

- Health Record: A patient's documentation of their healthcare encounters and the data created by the encounters across time
- EHR: Electronic Health Record

Health Records have been around for a very long time. As the need and capability arose to transition from paper to electronic medical records, EHR was born. There was even a law created to help this along. You might have heard of it. HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, was passed in 1996 to address this. You'll learn more about this in the EHR Data Security section of the course.

## key takeaways

### what is EHR
EHR data is the data being collected when we see a doctor, pick up a prescription at the pharmacy, or even from a visit to the dentist. These are just a few of the examples where EHR data is collected.

This data is used for a variety of use-cases. From personalizing healthcare to discovering novel drugs and treatments to helping providers diagnose patients better and reduce medical errors.

### how big is EHR?
To illustrate the scale of EHR data in the U.S. there are some estimates of about 30B healthcare claims just last year! Regardless of the exact amount, anything in this range shows the large volume of claims that are being processed. Besides the access, it is the high cost of healthcare in the U.S. For 2019, personal healthcare costs in the U.S. was projected to be $3.24T by CMS. This is an enormous amount and to put that in perspective that 3T number is almost 15% of the U.S. GDP for 2019. You can learn more about all of this by looking through the links below.

### source of EHR
EHR data can come from many different sources in today's world, such as:
- Heart rate monitors
- Xrays and other radiology scans
