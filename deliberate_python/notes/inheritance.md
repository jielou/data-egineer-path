# inheritance

5.18

## Intro

reference: 
- [Intro to oop in python]()
- [super()](https://realpython.com/python-super/)
- [OOP guide] (https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/)


## Unifired Modeling Language (UML)

a standardized way to view the design of a system

## inheritance
what common attributes and behaviors exist between real-world objects?

- is-a relationship
- liskov substitution principle: in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desired properties of the program


## composition
how are objects in the real world composed of one another?

- has-a relationship

## interface

a description of the features and behaviors an object has

- python does not have actual mechanisms called interfaces. instead conceptual idea.



## Super()

- super() returns a bound method: a method that is bound to the object, which gives the method the objectâ€™s context such as any instance attributes.

## Multiple Inheritance

when a class inherits two classes, if its inherited method from parents have different signatures, how Python decide which method to use?

**Method Resolution Order**
- `class.__mro__` tells you how Python decide the interitance order
- Python 3 uses C3 Linearization to generate MRO
- the first class in the inearization is itself
- In the employee system (in oop folder): 
    - L(E) = [E]
    - L(SE) = [SE] + merge(L(E), [E]) = [SE]+merge([E], [E]) = [SE, E]
    - L(HE) = [HE, E]
    - L(S) = [S] + merge(L(SE), [SE]) = [S]+merge([SE, E], [SE])=[S, SE,E]
    - L(TS) = [TS] +merge(L(S), L(HE), [S,HE]) = [TS]+merge([S,SE,E], [HE,E], [S,HE])=[TS,S]+merge([SE,E],[HE,E],[HE])=[TS,S,SE]+merge([SE,E],[HE,E],[HE])=[TS,S,SE,HE]+merge([E],[E])=[TS,S,SE,HE,E]


**The Diamond Problem**
- when class inherits from two or more classes, each of which inherits from a common class.
- better to rethink the class hierarchies 

## mixin

- `class Manager(Employee, Payroll)` tells python to first search method in Employee class and then Payroll class.
- `Manager.__mro__` to inspect the order
